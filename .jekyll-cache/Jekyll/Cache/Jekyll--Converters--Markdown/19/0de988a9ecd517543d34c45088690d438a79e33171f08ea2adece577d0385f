I"f<p>In the United States, in the 1950s and 1960s, cigarette brands were frequently sponsors of television programs. This changed in 1970, when the <em>The Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act</em> bill was introduced in congress,  after the 1964 report by the Surgeon General found that lung cancer and chronic bronchitis are causally related to cigarette smoking. Remarkly, the two major tobacco brands, which oligopolized the US Cigarette brands backed this bill, and after President Nixon signed  the bill into law, during the first year profits (on average) for cigarette companies increased by $91 million.</p>
